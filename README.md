# Band Family Tree program

This is a win32 console application project from class EE273:Design of Software Development at University of Strathclyde. It has been assessed by the lecturer.


# What it dose

This program allows the user to store information about different bands and related artists whether from extracting a pre-saved database (pure text file) or from console input. It supports information mofidication&searching based on band, artist or instrument and is able to output new modified database files

# How to run program

`git clone https://github.com/Xfan1025/EE273.git`

or

Download the zip file. Using visual studio 2017 is recommended. After setting up the project, one change of setting needs to be done before running the program:

project properties -> General -> Character Set -> Use multi-byte character set

Then just follow the instructions of the user-menu

# Attention

#use bandDatabase.txt as the band database iput file

#use artistDatabase.txt as the artists database input file


# What needs to be improved

For convenience, we just created text files to record the information as this program's "database". It shall be improved by creating database and accessing it using SQL.
