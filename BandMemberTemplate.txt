The file is formatted as follows:
NAME
BIRTH DATE
INSTRUMENT 1, INSTRUMENT 2, INSTRUMENT 3
BAND 1, BAND 2, BAND 3

If a person has been in more than one band then the INSTRUMENT is repeated depending on how many bands and his instrument for that band


The following members are from Red Hot Chilli Peppers and The Beatles, a couple of them have been in multiple bands together
and so i think this should be used for the search function
